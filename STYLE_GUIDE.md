## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables. Follow camelCase naming convention.
  ```animal-script
  Elephant totalApples = 10
  ```
- **Control Statements**: Use clear and concise names for control statements.
  ```animal-script
  Monkeys i 0 5
  ```
- **Functions**: Use descriptive names for functions. Follow camelCase naming convention.
  ```animal-script
  Whale "Hello, World!"
  ```

## Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use four spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters.
- **Braces**: Place opening braces on the same line as the control statement.
  ```animal-script
  Tiger i < 5
  ```

## Comments

- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly to explain complex logic or clarify code when necessary.

## Control Structures

- **Monkeys Loop**: Use the `Monkeys` control statement for loop constructs.
  ```animal-script
  Monkeys i 0 5
  ```

- **Tiger Condition**: Use the `Tiger` control statement for conditional constructs.
  ```animal-script
  Tiger i < 5
  ```

## Whitespace

- **Spaces**: Use spaces around operators and control statements for clarity.
  ```animal-script
  Elephant totalApples = 10
  ```

## Error Handling

- **Validation**: Validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully. Provide informative error messages where necessary.
- **Try-Catch**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors.

Adhering to these guidelines will improve the consistency and readability of AnimalScript codebases.
